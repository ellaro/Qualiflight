This Python script extracts and passes meteorological forecast data from a TAF (Terminal Aerodrome Forecast) message. It processes key weather elements such as the written timestamp, wind conditions, and forecast duration. The parsed data is stored in a dictionary format, making it useful for pilots and aviation professionals who need quick access to structured weather data.
